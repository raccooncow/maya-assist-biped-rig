## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts.
A Python rigging tool for Autodesk Maya, the user manually places key joints, and the program builds the rest of the rig, including hierarchy, controls, and IK/FK uses. This program will streamline the rigging process for animation, which is relevant to digital arts/media.

## Features
- User-placed joints/markers
    - The user will place core markers/joints that will be markers for the program to automatically make the remaining joints, set up hierarchy, orient them correctly, and apply constraints.
- IK/FK setup
    - The program will create inverse kinematics for the model's legs and forward kinematics for arms.
- Control curves
    - The program will create colored NURBS controls for joints and constrain them to the rig.
- Autonamic naming & organization
    - Automatically name joins, controls, groups, and IK/FK setups and arrange them in a clean hierarchy.
