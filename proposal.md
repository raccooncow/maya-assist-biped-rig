## Repository
<https://github.com/raccooncow/maya-assist-biped-rig.git>

## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts.
A Python rigging tool for Autodesk Maya, the user manually places key joints, and the program builds the rest of the rig, including hierarchy, controls, and IK/FK uses. This program will streamline the rigging process for animation, which is relevant to digital arts/media.

## Features
- User-placed joints/markers
    - The user will place core markers/joints that will be markers for the program to automatically make the remaining joints, set up hierarchy, orient them correctly, and apply constraints.
- IK/FK setup
    - The program will create inverse kinematics for the model's legs and forward kinematics for arms.
- Control curves
    - The program will create colored NURBS controls for joints and constrain them to the rig.
- Autonamic naming & organization
    - Automatically name joins, controls, groups, IK/FK setups and arrange them in a clean hierarchy.

## Challenges
- Learning how to use Maya Python and how to implement this program correctly.
- Arranging the hierarchy of all elements in the proper way.
- Creating IK/FK setup and correct implementation
- Handling mistake/error cases
- Making the program beginner-friendly

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The user will place important markers on already made joints, and the program will create the rest of the rig, which the program will instantly generate.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Correctly oriented joints, IK/FK joints, Controls + groups, proper hierarchy for all groups, IK/FK joints, Controls + groups, proper hierarchy for controls.
